
In the DOS box:
```
C:\ rustup update nightly
C:\ rustup component add --toolchain nightly rls-preview rust-analysis rust-src
```
Sometimes this will fail with:
```
warning: component 'rls-preview' is not available anymore on target 'x86_64-pc-windows-msvc'
```
Because these compenents don't get built with every nightly.
